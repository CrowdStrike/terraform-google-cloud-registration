## Description

This Terraform module provides automated registration and configuration of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) organizations, folders, and projects with CrowdStrike's Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) platform.

The module enables keyless authentication through GCP's Workload Identity Federation and provides security monitoring capabilities including asset inventory and optional real-time log ingestion for threat detection.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Scope Registration**: Support for organization, folder, and project-level registrations
- **Workload Identity Federation**: Secure, keyless authentication using GCP's identity federation  
- **Asset Inventory**: Monitoring of GCP resources for security posture assessment
- **Real Time Visibility & Detection** (Optional): Real-time log streaming for threat detection

### Architecture Overview

The module creates the following GCP resources:
- Workload Identity Pool and Provider for authentication
- IAM role bindings for CrowdStrike service principals across target scopes
- Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions for log ingestion (when RTV&D is enabled)
- Log sinks for audit log streaming (when RTV&D is enabled)
